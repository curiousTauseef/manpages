		<h3>
			Editing
		</h3>
		<p>
			Since <span class="lang">mdoc</span> is an ASCII-clean text format, it may be edited in any text editor.  In this
			section, I introduce a variety of editors available on most <a class="term" href="glossary.xml#unix">UNIX</a> systems.
			Since this topic is exhaustively covered in most any introductory UNIX book, I only introduce portable editors.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Ed
		</h4>
		<p>
			The <a href="commands.xml#cmd_ed" class="cmd">ed</a> utility is a line editor standardised by <a class="term"
				href="glossary.xml#posix">POSIX</a>.1-2008.  The concept of a line editor may be familiar to those who have used
			a typewriter or teleprinter, where only the current line of input may be edited (or viewed, in some cases) at a time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Its inclusion is largely for historical reasons, as using <a href="commands.xml#cmd_ed" class="cmd">ed</a> can be a
			frustrating experience for those accustomed to visual editors.  I don't recommend using this utility for <span
				class="lang">mdoc</span>, although its function as a line editor makes it perfect for the task.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Ex, Vi
		</h4>
		<p>
			The <a href="commands.xml#cmd_vi" class="cmd">vi</a> and <a href="commands.xml#cmd_ex" class="cmd">ex</a> editors were
			powerful additions to the UNIX system: they allowed visual editing of files (versus line editing as with <a
				href="commands.xml#cmd_ed" class="cmd">ed</a>).  This editor has inspired a raft of clones, but being
			standardised, some form of the utility is available on all UNIX systems.  Furthermore, the <a
				href="commands.xml#cmd_vim" class="cmd">vim</a> clone of <a href="commands.xml#cmd_vi" class="cmd">vi</a> comes
			bundled with <span class="lang">mdoc</span> syntax highlighting.
