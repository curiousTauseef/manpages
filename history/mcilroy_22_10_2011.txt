Yes

I believe it happened after his year in Berkeley. That would probably
make it about 1967 or 1968.

Yes.  AND...checking my files more carefully, I see that I called it
"runoff" in 1969.  By 1971 it was "roff".  Now I'm not so sure I got the
name from Morris.  Conceivably it came from Thompson, who was big on
shortening names.  My 1971 description came in January; the first ediion
Unix manual is dated December 1971.

If you wish, I can (in the fullness of time) try to scan any of the
three manuals: 1969 ( 12 pages), 1971 (18 pages), 1973 (32 pages).
