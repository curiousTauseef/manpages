I was definitely not part of the first joint effort to convert runoff.
I'm quite sure Morris was.  Canaday spent a year in our department about
that time, so his participation is possible, I was too confident in
writing that that conversion was done in assembly language; BCPL is a
possibility.

This paragraph, I think, is about as close to the truth as any of us can
reconstruct at this distance in time.  I have no memory of Ritchie being
involved, but then I didn't even know runoff was being ported until it
was a fait accompli. I suspect 1971 is a better date than 1970 for
Ritchie/Thompson roff--1970 would have been on the PDP7.

Dennis is acknowledged in my 1969 memo--for upgrading BCPL "to cope with
Runoff's special typographic needs."  That memo also cites "GE
Runoff"--presumably the Morris (et al) port, with documentation coming
from GE, and of course Saltzer.
