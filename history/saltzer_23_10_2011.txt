Kristaps,

You have my permission.  I believe that the only other entity that could
assert copyright is MIT, and its claim would be weak, because I never
assigned copyright on either the sources or the documentation.

A comment on the name "rf":  Because the modems and the mechanical
terminals of the day were slow, Multics gave most commands two names, a
long descriptive name and a short one for ease of typing.  Thus Multics
"runoff" was also named "rf".  (See the Multics Programmer's Guide for
documentation.)  When Thompson and Ritchie went off to develop Unix,
they generally adopted just the short names.  Thus the Multics "list |
ls"  became Unix "ls", etc.

Given the rumored GE-635 connection, I wonder if Bob Morris might have
had something to do with the Dartmouth College DTSS port?  It may be
worth looking for a DTSS historian and for the sources of the DTSS
version of RUNOFF.  I also recall that there was a GECOS-II TSS version
of RUNOFF which might have its roots in something that Bob did.  If Bob
was involved, probably his first step would have been to port BCPL to
GECOS II, rather than rewriting RUNOFF in 635 assembler.  And it may be
that the DTSS RUNOFF was just the binary of the GECOS-II TSS RUNOFF.

As you probably have figured out, Multics runoff was written in BCPL.
I don't know who did that port, but it was done by recompiling Doug's
CTSS ROFF using the version of BCPL that produced GE-645 code.  The
Multics BCPL sources of runoff from many years later are on-line, and
they have Bob Mabee's name all over them, but he may have just been a
later maintainer.

I only vaguely recall hearing about the compose project--I don't recall
any direct involvement.  Tom Van Vleck is almost certainly the most
authoritative source on that.

And best regards from sunny Boise, Idaho.  I'm glad to see someone
working to get to the bottom of some of these historical mysteries.
