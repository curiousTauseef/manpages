Tom, Kristaps,

Some comments & recollections:

The CTSS I refer to is the MIT Compatible Time-Sharing System.  I had
been much impressed by CTSS at MIT, and so I set out to build  a similar
system at Bell Labs. The Nike TSS that I and my team wrote ran on the GE
635 at Whippany. My memory is that we implemented it on the raw machine.
I wrote the IO stuff and remember handling interrupts from the IO
devices. However, my memory may be faulty here. I do know that we had to
work at night when we could have the whole machine to ourselves. I think
we wrote our own kernel (written, I believe, by Bob Harrison who later
wrote the kernel for our back-end database machine). 

The version we wrote on the GE 635 at Whippany was intended to be a
prototype. The final system was built on the Nike hardware (the same
hardware that ran the ABM system). That final version was written after
I joined the Multics project at Murray Hill.

The intent was that the GE 635 version of the Nike TSS was to be just a
prototype. However, the Nike programmers fell in love with it and the
comp center (which did not like it because they could not figure out how
to bill for it) was unable to shut it down for 5 years. The final
system, on the Nike hardware, was completed on time but never used.

We implemented much of the same stuff that was on CTSS, although we did
not use any CTSS code. We built the system from scratch in GE 635
assembler. I am just guessing that we may have implemented a version of
runoff.

You are correct that the TSS at Indian Hill was TSS/360. Multics ran
only at Murray Hill. It may have been abandoned when Bell Labs pulled
out of the Multics project. I don't remember. Certainly Bell Labs
management felt badly burned by Multics. The intent had been to use it
in all the BTL comp centers.

I thought I got BCPL from MIT, but if it was not at MIT until 1967 I
must have gotten it elsewhere (Cambridge?). In any case, i think I got
the code from somewhere and then re-wrote it, although I may have
implemented it from scratch. Dennis, as I mentioned, implemented the IO
library. I wrote the BCPL manual used at Bell Labs. Later Ken designed
and built an interpreted language named Bon (after his wife Bonnie). Bon
+ BCPL became B, a short-lived language that then became C (by Dennis).

As for PL/1, the company that was building the compiler had offices in
New York. I spent one summer commuting there to "supervise" the work,
although I did not accomplish much except to learn that the project was
a mess. I thought it was CA but perhaps it was Digitek. I have a vague
memory that EPL was intended to be an interim solution.

All of this was a long time ago, and i have very few records from then.
Because of other stuff in my life at that time (which I'm willing to
share if you like) I was pretty distracted much of the time.
