Kristaps --

No problem if you want to include our correspondence.

I did mean Saltzer's RUNOFF, which I used at least a little during the
summer I spent working at Project MAC (1966).

I don't recall anything about Bob Morris's involvement with any of this,
though it's possible that Roger Faulkner might have picked up some of
that code for the GE-635.  More likely it was Doug's code, though don't
quote me on that.  Fortunately both Doug and Roger are around to ask.

I'll see if I can scan my Roff manual.
