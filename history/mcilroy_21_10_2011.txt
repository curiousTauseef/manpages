Actually I never saw any source from the runoff trunk and branch of the
family tree.  I can't remember what language Morris programmed his
verion in.

I don't perfectly remember the sequence of events, when runoff was
ported to the pre-Multics platform, the GE-635.  I was not involved.  I
wanted to extend the runoff model so began over, writing in BCPL.  This
new roff ran in Bell Labs comp centers as long as they had GE machines.
(I have the 1973 edition of the manual.) It was reimplemented for Unix
by Thompson and Ritchie--in assembly language, I believe.

I believe Morris christened his port "roff" to distintuish it from
runoff when both programs were running on CTSS.  I borrowed the name.  I
do not know whether my roff was adopted by Multics.  You can tell by
seeing whether the extensions are in the Multics manual.

After T&R, Ossanna wrote nroff, which was still more elaborate, and
parlayed that in turn to troff when the CAT phototypesetter arrived.
Kernighan (who had written his own formatting program when he was at
Princeton) stepped in upon Ossanna's death.

Roff was in the first edition Unix manual, 1971; nroff appeared in the
second, 1972; troff in the fourth, 1973.  Thanks to troff the fourth
edition was the thinnest Unix manual ever printed.
