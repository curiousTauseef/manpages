the roffs all descend from runoff from mit's ctss system.  i wrote rf
(then roff) for the pdp-7 for some early manual work someone else
(probably dennis) wrote roff in c on the pdp-11.  this version of roff
was written to do patent applications.  the patent application was the
justification for getting the pdp-11.

joe ossanna wrote nroff, which was kinda programmable via macros. then
with a large set of macros it could emulate roff. he then added fonts
and sizes to make troff for the newly interfaced typesetter.  brian
kernighan (i think) combined nroff and troff to be the same program.

i did the start of the man pages and set up the title/synopsis/...
stuff. the loose prototype for the man pages was the multics man (MSPM).
the mspm was much wordier and less structured, but many sections had
similar headings.

this is my best recollection, but certainly could be wrong.
