Sure, no problem.

Physically I was at Bell Labs in Murray Hill.  During the Multics
project, though, we did lots of remote computing at CTSS.  I do not
remember whether I began working on runoff before or after we withdrew
from Multics.

I'm quite sure it was GECOS.  If the BCPL got to CTSS, that resolves my
uncertainty about timing relative to BTL's withdrawal from Multics.

It was GE, not Honeywell.  I didn't pay attention to the nomenclature of
GECOS versions.
