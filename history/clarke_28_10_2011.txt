It was the troff that came with SunOS 4.1.4.  IIRC, I did most of the
development on a Sun 4/110.  At the time, Tiemann started on g++ using a
Sun 4, so g++ worked best on a Sparc.

The main documentation I used was the V7 troff manual.

I wanted to donate something to GNU and I was also interested in
typography (mostly as a result of having read the TeXBook). Troff was
one of the few major classic Unix programs that had yet to be
implemented at that point.

The former. It was written in order to be contributed to GNU.

I can't find anything on my disk.  Maybe they are on a backup tape
somewhere.  There might be something on a tape somewhere.  I have
something that I think are the original RCS files I used for
development.  I can send those to you if you want.

Sure. Thanks for your interest.
