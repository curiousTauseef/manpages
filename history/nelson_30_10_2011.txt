There was a group in Bell Labs, not in Research but the Development
side, that supported Unix, mostly for the telephone companies. Headed by
Joe Maranzano, they packaged and supported DWB, which consisted mostly
of programs developed in Research. The original DWB supporters included
Molly Wagner.  This group was eventually spun off as Unix Systems
Laboratory.

The starting point of DWB is mentioned here, though that name is never
mentioned. But the pieces are there.  So I'm guessing around 1978 for
the start of DWB.

Nils-Peter,

Thanks for your response!  This has set me upon a track that's
surprisingly difficult to follow from public sources: the DWB.

Do you know of any documentation (or source) of the original DWB?  I
can't find exactly when troff formally begat it: can you fill in any
dates and places?

Yes, he corroborates this (eqn in particular has a nice long source
trail in the UNIX archives).

Lastly, do you mind if I include these letters in the history?  Of
course, I'll redact all email headers (except date, subject, and names).

Thanks,

Kristaps
