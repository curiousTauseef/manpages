		<h3>
			Spell-checking
		</h3>
		<p>
			The right or wrong spelling of terms in technical documents is very important.  Thus, it's always important to carefully
			spell-check your manuals, making sure that both technical and general terms are correctly spelt.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, spell-checking a <span class="lang">mdoc</span> document is fairly difficult, as the spell-checker must
			have some knowledge of the language structure to discern text from macros.  Consider spell-checking checking the
			following snippet.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			.Fl Alu Ar input
		</div>
		<p>
			By now we understand that <a class="macro" href="macros.xml#macro_fl">Fl</a> and <a class="macro"
				href="macros.xml#macro_ar">Ar</a> are macros.  But it's unreasonable to expect a spell-checker to do so.  Thus,
			spell-checking manuals often raise many false-positives.
		</p>
		<h4>
			spell
		</h4>
		<p>
			The <span class="cmd">spell</span> utility is distributed with many <a class="term" href="glossary.xml#bsd_unix">BSD
				UNIX</a> operating systems as a simplistic spell-checker.  In fact, it was first distributed with the Sixth
			Edition of UNIX.  <span class="cmd">spell</span> preprocesses its input with <span class="cmd">deroff</span>, another
			historic utility with some functionality of stripping <span class="lang">roff</span> instructions from files.
		</p>
		<p>
			To print a list of all unknown words, you can explicitly invoke <span class="cmd">deroff</span> and <span
				class="cmd">spell</span> as follows:
		</p>
		<div class="cmdline">
			deroff -w file.1 | spell
		</div>
		<p>
			A utility distributed with <a href="glossary.xml#mandoc" class="cmd">mandoc</a>, <span class="cmd">demandoc</span>,
			is significantly stronger than <span class="cmd">deroff</span>.  If available, it should be used instead.  It has the
			same calling syntax of <span class="cmd">deroff</span>.
		</p>
		<div class="cmdline">
			demandoc -w file.1 | spell
		</div>
		<table class="nav">
