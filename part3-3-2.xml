		<h3>
			Spell-checking
		</h3>
		<p>
			The right or wrong spelling of terms in technical documents is very important.  Thus, it's always important to carefully
			spell-check your manuals, making sure that both technical and general terms are correctly spelt.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, spell-checking a <span class="lang">mdoc</span> document is fairly difficult, as the spell-checker must
			have some knowledge of the language structure to discern text from macros.  Consider spell-checking checking the
			following snippet.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			.Fl Alu Ar input
		</div>
		<p>
			By now we understand that <a class="macro" href="macros.xml#macro_fl">Fl</a> and <a class="macro"
				href="macros.xml#macro_ar">Ar</a> are macros.  But it's unreasonable to expect a spell-checker to do so.  Thus,
			spell-checking manuals often raise many false-positives.
		</p>
		<h4>
			spell
		</h4>
		<p>
			The <span class="cmd">spell</span> utility is distributed with many <a class="term" href="glossary.xml#bsd_unix">BSD
				UNIX</a> operating systems as a simplistic spell-checker.  In fact, it was first distributed with the Sixth
			Edition of UNIX.  <span class="cmd">spell</span> preprocesses its input with <span class="cmd">deroff</span>, another
			historic utility with some functionality of stripping <span class="lang">roff</span> instructions from files.
		</p>
		<p>
			To print a list of all unknown words, you can explicitly invoke <span class="cmd">deroff</span> and <span
				class="cmd">spell</span> as follows:
		</p>
		<div class="cmdline">
			deroff -w file.1 | spell
		</div>
		<p>
			A utility distributed with <a href="glossary.xml#mandoc" class="cmd">mandoc</a>, <span class="cmd">demandoc</span>,
			is significantly stronger than <span class="cmd">deroff</span>.  If available, it should be used instead.  It has the
			same calling syntax of <span class="cmd">deroff</span>.
		</p>
		<div class="cmdline">
			demandoc -w file.1 | spell
		</div>
		<p>
			You can also maintain a per-manual list of technical terms by using additional word lists.  In the case of <span
				class="file">file.1</span>, consider a sorted list of words <span class="file">file.1.words</span> we're
			maintaining with special words (such as names).  We could then augment a <span class="cmd">make</span> rule to
			automatically make sure additions are spell-checked.
		</p>
		<div class="screen">
			file.1: file.1.words
			<br />
			<br />
			.in.1.1:
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mandoc -Tlint $&lt;
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;test -z `demandoc -w $&lt; | spell -b +$@.words`
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cp -f $&lt; $@
		</div>
		<p>
			This snippet first makes the build of <span class="file">file.1</span> depend upon its local word file, <span
				class="file">file.1.words</span>, a sorted list of words to ignore.  When <span class="file">file.in.1</span> or
			<span class="file">file.1.words</span> is updated, the rule is executed.  It first makes sure that <span
				class="file">file.in.1</span> is well-formed, then spell-checks it against the ignored-words file.
		</p>
		<h4>
			ispell, aspell
		</h4>
		<p>
			Another common spell-checker is <span class="cmd">ispell</span> and its <a class="term" href="glossary.xml#gnu">GNU</a>
			replacement <span class="cmd">aspell</span>.  I do not suggest using these utilities because of their poor internal
			support for <span class="lang">mdoc</span>.  It's possible, however, to send stripped files for checking in a manner
			similar to <span class="cmd">spell</span>:
		</p>
		<div class="cmdline">
			demandoc -w file.1 | ispell -l
		</div>
		<p>
			Both <span class="cmd">ispell</span> and <span class="cmd">aspell</span> also have a pipe mode for more meaningful
			output:
		</p>
		<div class="cmdline">
			demandoc -w file.1 | ispell -a
		</div>
		<table class="nav">
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td class="nav-home"><a href="http://manpages.bsd.lv/index.html">Home</a></td>
					<td class="nav-next"><a href="part3-3-3.xml">Next</a></td>
					<td class="nav-history"><a href="http://manpages.bsd.lv/cgi-bin/cvsweb/part3-3-2.xml?cvsroot=manpages">History</a></td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
