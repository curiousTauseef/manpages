			Manual Syntax and Structure
		</h1>
		<p>
			In the last part, I introduced some <span class="lang">mdoc</span> language syntax by way of example.  We covered <a
				href="part1-1.xml#commands">Commands</a> and <a href="part1-2.xml#functions">Functions</a>.  In this part,
			I'll study the structure of the UNIX manual itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			Historically, the syntax and structure of <span class="lang">mdoc</span> derive from the <a class="lang term"
				href="glossary.xml#roff">roff</a>, a text processing language predating the first editions of <a class="term"
				href="glossary.xml#unix">UNIX</a>.  In fact, the general syntax of <span class="lang">roff</span> (and thus
			<span class="lang">mdoc</span>) can be traced to the <a class="term" href="glossary.xml#runoff">RUNOFF</a> command
			from the mid-sixties!  The conventions of section names and manual categories were formalised later, in the early
			seventies, with the First Edition UNIX <a class="term" href="glossary.xml#unix_programmers_manual">Programmer's
				Manual</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although the focus of this book is obviously on <span class="lang">mdoc</span>, a great deal of its idiosyncracies
			derive from <span class="lang">roff</span>, so we'll spend some time discussing seemingly-unnecessary complexity in the
			context of general text processing.
		</p>
		<p>
			I reiterate that this is <i>not</i> a canonical <span class="lang">mdoc</span> reference: <span class="lang">mdoc</span>
			is not a standard, and varies in subtle ways across formatters and operating systems.  In this part, I'll discuss only
			the portable parts of <span class="lang">mdoc</span>.
