			Manual Syntax and Structure
		</h1>
		<p>
			In the last part, I introduced some <span class="lang">mdoc</span> language syntax by way of example.  In this part,
			I'll study the structure of the UNIX manual itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			The syntax and structure of <span class="lang">mdoc</span> are closely tied to <a class="lang term"
				href="glossary.xhtml#roff">roff</a>, a text processing language predating the first editions of <a class="term"
				href="glossary.xhtml#unix">UNIX</a>.  In fact, the general syntax of <span class="lang">mdoc</span> can be
			traced to the <a class="external"
				href="http://mit.edu/saltzer/www/publications/ctss/AH.9.01.html">RUNOFF</a>
			utility developed in 1964 by Jerome H. Saltzer for the
			CTSS operating system.  
		</p>
		<blockquote cite="http://mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/CC-244.html">
			<p>
				<u>Control Words</u>:
			</p>
			<p>
				Input generally consists of English text, 360 or  fewer characters to a line.  Control words must begin a new
				line, and begin with a period so that they  may  be  distinguished from other text.  RUNOFF does not print the
				control  words.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			The conventions of section names and manual categories were later formalised in the <a class="external"
				href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/1stEdman.html">UNIX Programmer's Manual</a> for the First Edition
			UNIX, 1971. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I reiterate that this is <i>not</i> a canonical <span class="lang">mdoc</span> reference: <span class="lang">mdoc</span>
			is not a standard, and varies in subtle ways across formatters and operating systems.  In this part, I'll discuss only
			the portable parts of <span class="lang">mdoc</span>.
