			Punctuation
		</h3>
		<p>
			The <span class="lang">mdoc</span> language, in descending from the type-setting language <a class="lang term"
				href="glossary.xhtml#roff">roff</a>, has significant type-setting capabilities.  Punctuation is treated
			specially in all <span class="lang">mdoc</span> documents, both in terms of macro and text lines.
		</p>
		<p>
			The following characters are considered punctuation:
		</p>
		<table id="punctuation_table" class="tbl">
			<col style="width: 5em;" />
			<col />
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="screen">!</span></td>
					<td>ending sentence</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="screen">&quot;</span></td>
					<td>ending enclosure</td>

		<p>
			These are treated specially by the formatter when used in macro lines and at the end of text lines.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Sentential Punctuation
		</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				End of Sentence, End of Line.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			The end of a sentence should always be at the end of a line.  This way, the formatter can recognise a sentence by the
			punctuation used and insert the correct amount of spaces.  If supported by the output media (<a class="term"
				href="glossary.xhtml#html">HTML</a>, for example, does not), all modern <span class="lang">mdoc</span>
			formatters use <a class="term" href="glossary.xhtml#english_spacing">English spacing</a> to mark sentence boundaries.
			The <q>ending sentence</q> punctuation in the <a href="#punctuation_table">punctuation table</a> marks an end of sentence.
		</p>
		<p>
			In <a href="part2-1-1.xhtml#text_line">text lines</a>, sentence punctuation should always occur at the end of the line.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			End of sentence.
			<br />
			End of line.
			<br />
			(&quot;Even with nested sentences.&quot;)
		</div>
		<p>
			Note, in the last sentence, that the formatter will recognise sentence punctuation even when followed by <q>ending
				enclosure</q> punctuation as noted in the <a href="#punctuation_table">punctuation table</a>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			However, take care that non-sentence punctuation, such as for abbreviations, does not happen to fall at
			the line boundary.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			Paging Dr.
			<br />
			Freud.
		</div>
		<p>
			In this case, the formatter will interpret <span class="screen">Dr.</span> as ending a sentence.  In this event, you can
			either restructure your line or add a zero-width escape following the period.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			Paging Dr.\&amp;
			<br />
			Freud.
		</div>
		<p>
			<a href="part2-1-1.xhtml#macro_line">Macro lines</a> are slightly more complicated.  The same rules apply, but
			punctuation marks must be separated by spaces.  The formatter will understand the role of the punctuation and remove the
			spaces accordingly, or reorder sentence and closing punctuation.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			Text (parenthesised
			<br />
			.Em text ) .
			<br />
			.Qq Properly period-closed quotation .
		</div>
		<p>
			The punctuation may be escaped by either a trailing escape, as in the text case, or a preceding escape.  In this case it
			is not considered punctuation, but regular text.  Note that this will also cause an intervening space to be printed.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			.Em End of sentence .
			<br />
			.Em Not end of sentence \&amp;.
			<br />
			.Em Not end of sentence .\&amp;
		</div>
		<h4>
			Regular Punctuation
		</h4>
		<p>
			Non-sentential text line punctuation &mdash; commas, parenthesis, quotes, etc.&mdash; is a matter of literal printing.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			Some text (punctuation), another "clause".
		</div>
		<p>
			The rules for macro lines are the same but for <a href="part2-1-4.xhtml#inline_macros">in-line macros</a>, which might
			decorate individual terms with text.  In this case, punctuation as a standalone argument is specially treated in that it
			is not decorated, and whitespace removed according to the punctuation type (opening, closing).
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			.Em ( Nicely spaced and decorated . )
			<br />
			.Em (All text decorated, no end-of-sentence.)
			<br />
			.Em ( Text alright , excepting the period \&amp;. )
		</div>
		<p>
			In the second example, <span class="screen">(All</span> and <span class="screen">end-of-sentence.)</span> are considered
			arguments, and thus not accomodated for in terms of punctuation.  In the third, the period is escaped and thus
			considered regular text.
