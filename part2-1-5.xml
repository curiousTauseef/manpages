			Punctuation
		</h3>
		<p>
			The <span class="lang">mdoc</span> language, in descending from the type-setting language <a class="lang term"
				href="glossary.xhtml#roff">roff</a>, has significant type-setting capabilities.  Punctuation is treated
			specially in all <span class="lang">mdoc</span> documents, both in terms of macro and text lines.
		</p>
		<p>
			The following characters are considered punctuation:
		</p>
		<a name="punctuation" />
		<table>
			<col style="width: 5em;" />
			<col />
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="screen">!</span></td>
					<td>ending sentence</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="screen">&quot;</span></td>
					<td>ending enclosure</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="screen">(</span></td>
					<td>opening enclosure</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="screen">)</span></td>
					<td>ending enclosure</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><span class="screen">,</span></td>
					<td>ending</td>

					<td><span class="screen">.</span></td>
					<td>ending sentence</td>

			These are treated specially by the formatter when used in macro lines and at the end of text lines.
		</p>
		<h4>
			End of Sentence, End of Line
		</h4>
		<p>
			The end of a sentence should always be at the end of a line.  This way, the formatter can recognise a sentence by the
			punctuation used and insert the correct amount of spaces.  If supported by the output media (<a class="term"
				href="glossary.xhtml#html">HTML</a>, for example, does not), all modern <span class="lang">mdoc</span>
			formatters use <a class="term" href="glossary.xhtml#english_spacing">English spacing</a> to mark sentence boundaries.
			The <q>ending sentence</q> punctuation in the <a href="#punctuation">punctuation table</a> marks an end of sentence.
		</p>
		<p>
			In <a href="part2-1-1.xhtml#text_lines">text lines</a>, sentence punctuation should always occur at the end of the line.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			End of sentence.
			<br />
			End of line.
			<br />
			(&quot;Even with nested sentences.&quot;)
		</div>
		<p>
			Note, in the last sentence, that the formatter will recognise sentence punctuation even when followed by <q>ending
				enclosure</q> punctuation as noted in the <a href="#punctuation">punctuation table</a>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			However, take care that non-sentence punctuation, such as for abbreviations, does not happen to fall at
			the line boundary.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			Paging Dr.
			<br />
			Freud.
		</div>
		<p>
			In this case, the formatter will interpret <span class="screen">Dr.</span> as ending a sentence.  In this event, you can
			either restructure your line or add a zero-width escape following the period.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			Paging Dr.\&amp;
			<br />
			Freud.
		</div>
		<p>
			<a href="part2-1-1.xhtml#macro_line">Macro lines</a> are slightly more complicated.  The same rules apply, but
			punctuation marks must be separated by spaces.  The formatter will understand the role of the punctuation and remove the
			spaces accordingly.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			Text (parenthesised
			<br />
			.Em text ) .
		</div>
		<p>
			The punctuation may be escaped by either a trailing escape, as in the text case, or a preceding escape.  In this case it
			is not considered punctuation, but regular text.  Note that this will also cause an intervening space to be printed.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			.Em End of sentence .
			<br />
			.Em Not end of sentence \&amp;.
			<br />
			.Em Not end of sentence .\&amp;
		</div>
		<h4>
			Inter-Macro Punctuation
		</h4>
		<p>
			Text line punctuation &mdash; commas, parenthesis, quotes &quot; is a matter of literal printing.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			Some text (punctuation), another "clause".
		</div>
		<p>
			The rules for macros are slightly more complicated, as not all
