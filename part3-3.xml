			Composition
		</h2>
		<p>
			Since the UNIX manual has such a rich history of development, it would be strange were it not to have a significant body
			of supporting tools for composition.  In fact, the First Edition of <a class="term" href="glossary.xml#unix">UNIX</a>
			was bundled with a set of tools, the UNIX Writer's Workbench, specifically for composing documents &mdash;
			spell-checking, grammar-checking, editing, and so forth.
		</p>
		<p>
			These tools are, sadly, no longer distributed with most UNIX systems.  Even the topic of spell-checking is no longer
			standardised.  However, the situation isn't so grim: the <a class="term cmd" href="glossary.xml#vi">vi</a> editor is
			stipulated by <a class="term" href="glossary.xml#posix">POSIX</a>.1-2008.  And although a spell-checker is not, there
			are several widely-distributed spell-checkers available.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the best parts of <span class="lang">mdoc</span> is that none of these specific tools are necessary: an <span
				class="lang">mdoc</span> document is just a text file and may be composed in any editor.
