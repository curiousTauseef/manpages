			Composition
		</h2>
		<p>
			Since the UNIX manual has such a rich history of development, it would be strange were it not to have a significant body
			of supporting tools for composition.  In fact, the seventh edition of <a class="term" href="glossary.xml#unix">UNIX</a>
			was bundled with a set of tools, the UNIX <a class="term" href="glossary.xml#wwb">Writer's Workbench</a>, specifically
			for composing documents &mdash; spell-checking, grammar-checking, and so forth.  Even then, sophisticated editors had
			long since been a pivotal part of UNIX.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although the <span class="cmd">ed</span>, <span class="cmd">ex</span>, and <span class="cmd">vi</span> editors are
			stipulated by <a class="term" href="glossary.xml#posix">POSIX</a>.1-2008, the Writer's Workbench has long since been
			discontinued.  Even spell-checkers are not standard across modern UNIX systems, although many high-quality editors and
			composition utilities may be downloaded.
		</p>
		<p>
			In short, the situation is messy: composing <span class="lang">mdoc</span> documents (and in fact any <span
				class="lang">roff</span> document) is tricky to do portably.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, one of the best parts of <span class="lang">mdoc</span> is that none of these specific tools are necessary: an
			<span class="lang">mdoc</span> document is just a text file and may be composed in any editor, and its text contents
			analysed by any utility smart enough to ignore <span class="lang">mdoc</span> syntax.
