		<h3>
			Input Encoding
		</h3>
		<p>
			Without exception, a well-formed <span class="lang">mdoc</span> document consists only of <a class="term"
				href="glossary.xhtml#ascii">ASCII</a> printable characters, the space character, the newline character, and in
			some cases the tab character.  Most modern formatters allow for CR+LF newlines <span class="screen">\r\n</span>, but
			this is not portable.  There is no limit to line length.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unilaterally, the backslash <span class="screen">\</span> is always interpreted as the beginning of an <a
				href="part2-1-2.xhtml">escape sequence</a>.  If an escape precedes a newline, it escapes the current line:
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			.Em This is considered one \
			<br />
			line of input.
		</div>
		<h4>
			<a name="macro_line" />
			Macro Line
		</h4>
		<p>
			Formally speaking, a macro line is one beginning with a control character.  In <span class="lang">mdoc</span>, this is
			traditionally the <span class="screen">.</span> character, although historical documents may also use the <span
				class="screen">'</span> character.  This notation extends back to the <a class="external"
				href="http://mit.edu/saltzer/www/publications/ctss/AH.9.01.html">RUNOFF</a> utility developed in 1964 by Jerome
			H. Saltzer for the CTSS operating system.
		</p>
		<blockquote cite="http://mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/CC-244.html">
			<p>
				<u>Control Words</u>:
			</p>
			<p>
				Input generally consists of English text, 360 or  fewer characters to a line.  Control words must begin a new
				line, and begin with a period so that they  may  be  distinguished from other text.  RUNOFF does not print the
				control  words.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			A line with only a control character followed by zero or more whitespace characters is stripped from input.
		</p>
		<p>
			A macro line may, in some circumstances, contain more macros.  The first macro &mdash; the one following the control
			character &mdash; may then be distinguished as the line macro.
		</p>
		<p>
			On macro lines the following non-alphanumeric characters are syntactically meaningful as follows.  These characters are
			collectively called reserved characters.

			To pass these characters along as literal text, you must either escape or quote them.

		<h4>
			Text Line

		<p>
			A text line is any line <i>not</i> beginning with a control character.  Text lines are never parsed for macros and may
			consist of printable ASCII character.
