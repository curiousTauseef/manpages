			Input Encoding
		</h3>
		<p>
			Without exception, a well-formed <span class="lang">mdoc</span> document consists only of <a class="term"
				href="glossary.xhtml#ascii">ASCII</a> printable characters, the space character, the newline character, and in
			some cases the tab character.  Most modern formatters allow for CR+LF newlines <span class="screen">\r\n</span>, but
			this is not portable.  There is no limit to line length.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unilaterally, the backslash <span class="screen">\</span> is always interpreted as the beginning of an <a
				href="part2-1-2.xhtml">escape sequence</a>.  If an escape precedes a newline, it escapes the current line:
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			.Em This is considered one \
			<br />
			line of input.
		</div>
		<h4>
			<a name="macro_line" />
			Macro Line
		</h4>
		<p>
			Formally speaking, a macro line is one beginning with a control character.  In <span class="lang">mdoc</span>, this is
			traditionally the <span class="screen">.</span> character, although historical documents may also use the <span
				class="screen">'</span> character.  This notation extends back to the <a class="external"
				href="http://mit.edu/saltzer/www/publications/ctss/AH.9.01.html">RUNOFF</a> utility developed in 1964 by Jerome
			H. Saltzer for the CTSS operating system.
		</p>
		<blockquote cite="http://mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/CC-244.html">
			<p>
				<u>Control Words</u>:
			</p>
			<p>
				Input generally consists of English text, 360 or  fewer characters to a line.  Control words must begin a new
				line, and begin with a period so that they  may  be  distinguished from other text.  RUNOFF does not print the
				control  words.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			A line with only a control character followed by zero or more whitespace characters is stripped from input.
		</p>
		<p>
			A macro line may, in some circumstances, contain more macros.  The first macro &mdash; the one following the control
			character &mdash; may then be distinguished as the line macro.
		</p>
		<p>
			On macro lines the following non-alphanumeric characters are syntactically meaningful as follows.  These characters are
			collectively called reserved characters.

		<p>
			To pass these characters along as literal text, you must either escape or quote them.
		</p>
		<p>
			If an unescaped space character is encountered on a macro line, it is used to delimit macros, macro arguments, and
			flags.  Multiple consecutive space characters have no effect on output.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			.Em Hello,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World
			<br />
			.Em Hello, World
		</div>
		<p>
			The spaces between <span class="screen">Hello,</span> and <span class="screen">world</span> delimit arguments in this
			case, and produce the same output.
		</p>
		<h4>
			<a name="text_line" />
			Text Line
		</h4>
		<p>
			A text line is any line <i>not</i> beginning with a control character.  Text lines are never parsed for macros and may
			consist of printable ASCII character.  Text lines are concatenated together when forming output, so unless in certain
			circumstances, newlines are stripped from input.  Using a blank text line as a vertical separator is not portable.
		</p>
		<p>
			If a space character is encountered on a text line, it is reproduced verbatim in the output.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			Hello,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World
			<br />
			Hello, World
		</div>
		<p>
			Thus, the spaces between <span class="screen">Hello,</span> and <span class="screen">world</span> will be reproduced in
			output.  In general, however, it is considered non-portable to use spaces on a text-line to shape output: <a
				class="term" href="glossary.xhtml#html">HTML</a> by default collapses whitespace.  A literal display mode should
			be used instead.
		</p>
		<p>
			Furthermore, if the first letter of a text line is a space character, the output line shall be preceded by a newline.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			Hello, World.
			<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;The newline and leading spaces are retained.
			<br />
			While this is not.
		</div>
		<p>
			This behaviour should also not be assumed; a literal display mode should be opened instead.
		</p>
