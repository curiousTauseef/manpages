			Basic Syntax
		</h2>
		<p>
			Before studying the structure of <span class="lang">mdoc</span> manuals, let's formalise the language we've seen so far.
			We've already noted that <span class="lang">mdoc</span> documents are line-based: some lines, demarked by a leading
			<span class="screen">.</span>, are interpreted as macros.  Those without the leading <span class="screen">.</span> are
			free-text.  We've even seen examples of partial-line and full-line comments.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			.Xx Arguments to the macro Xx.
			<br />
			Free-form text. \" A partial comment.
			<br />
			.\" A full-line comment.
		</div>
		<p>
			This is unfinished...
