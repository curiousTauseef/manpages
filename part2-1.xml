		<h2>
			Basic Syntax
		</h2>
		<p>
			Before studying the structure of <span class="lang">mdoc</span> manuals, let's review the language we've seen so far.
			Foremost, we've noticed that <span class="lang">mdoc</span> documents consist only of printable ASCII characters.
		</p>
		<p>
			We noted that a period at the beginning of a line indicates a <a class="term"
				href="glossary.xhtml#mdoc_macro">macro</a>:
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			.Qq hello, world
		</div>
		<p>
			It's safe to say, in this case, that <span class="lang">mdoc</span> is line-oriented in that programme flow is in part
			governed by position on a line.  In the case of <span class="macro">Qq</span>, we saw how the macro extends to the end
			of the line.  This is also the first notion of <a class="term" href="glossary.xhtml#mdoc_scope">scope</a>, specifically
			scoping to the end of line.  We then saw examples where scope covers multiple lines and accomodates for nested macros as
			well as text.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			.Sh DESCRIPTION
			<br />
			The
			<br />
			.Nm
			<br />
			utility...
		</div>
		<p>
			We were briefly introduced to the concept of macros accepting flags and flag arguments.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			.Bl -tag -width Ds
			<br />
			.It List key.
			<br />
			List value.
			<br />
			.El
		</div>
		<p>
			Finally, we noted that double-quotes have special semantic significance, which led to the topic of escaped terms such as
			<span class="screen">\(dq</span> for a double-quote character.  We also saw how punctuation is treated in special ways
			when lying at line boundaries.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocin">
			End of sentence, end of line.
			<br />
			Same goes with
			<br />
			.Em macros .
		</div>
		<p>
			In this chapter, we'll formalise these concepts.  I'll draw my terminology from the literature of formal languages and
			grammar, but it's not necessary to be familiar with the terms beforehand.
