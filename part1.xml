			Tutorial Introduction
		</h1>
		<p>
			Let's begin with practical examples of <span class="lang">mdoc</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The intended audience of this part is somebody who has never written a <span class="lang">mdoc</span> manual.  Although
			you may be tempted to jump to the chapter relevant to your manual type (for example, a command or function library),
			it's best to read the chapters in order.  I'll explain <span class="lang">mdoc</span> syntax as we go.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you've already written a few manuals, you may want to read this part anyway: beyond explaining technical <span
				class="lang">mdoc</span> language concepts by example, I'll also introduce some best practises and discuss
			portability between various <span class="lang">mdoc</span> environments.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'll frequently refer to the screen output of <span class="lang">mdoc</span> documents as they're displayed by the
			classical UNIX <span class="cmd">man</span> utility.  Furthermore, I'll refer to invoking utilities in the traditional
			UNIX way &mdash; on the <a class="term" href="glossary.xml#command_line">command line</a>.  Due to both of these
			caveats, a bit of UNIX knowledge will help to avoid confusion, but I'll briefly introduce invocation syntaxes as the
			need arises.
		</p>
		<p>
			For those interested, these output snippets are generated by <a href="commands.xml#cmd_mandoc" class="cmd">mandoc</a>'s
			<a href="glossary.xml#xhtml" class="term">XHTML</a> output mode.
