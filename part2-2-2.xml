			Document Body
		</h3>
		<p>
			The document body begins with the first macro not in the prologue set (<span class="macro">Dd</span>, <span
				class="macro">Dt</span>, and <span class="macro">Os</span>).  The document body consists of the manual content
			itself, and varies significantly between categories and, of course, the material itself.
		</p>
		<pre>
.\" Prologue follows:
.Dd May 26 2011
.Dt MDOC 7
.Os
.\" Document body follows:
.Sh NAME
.Nm mdoc
.Nd mdoc language reference
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm mdoc
language is used to format
.Bx
.Ux
manuals.
		</pre>
		<p>
			The content of the document body is divided into sections.  Sections are indicated by the <span class="macro">Sh</span>
			macro.
		</p>
		<div class="mdocsyntax">
			.<span class="macro">Sh</span> <span class="macroarg">SECTION NAME</span>
			<br />
			Text within the section...
		</div>
		<p>
			As described in the introduction, a section consists of its line arguments and all subsequent lines until the end of
			file or another <span class="macro">Sh</span> macro.
		</p>
		<p>
			By convention, <span class="macro">Sh</span> arguments are capitalised.  I'll describe conventional sections at length
			in the next chapter, as for the most part follow long-standing document conventions.
		</p>
		<p>
			In general, the document body requires at least the <span class="sec">NAME</span> and <span
				class="sec">DESCRIPTION</span> sections, and usually the <span class="sec">SYNOPSIS</span> section as well.  The
			first section must be <span class="sec">NAME</span>, optionally followed by <span class="sec">SYNOPSIS</span>.  The
			<span class="sec">DESCRIPTION</span> section must follow either the <span class="sec">NAME</span> or <span
				class="sec">SYNOPSIS</span>.
